# M1-groupassignment

### Definition of a problem statement and a short outline of the implementation

The problem statement of our project is to find what are the most important attributes of tennis matches that have impact on loss or win of the match and to build relevant models in order to predict the outcome of the match on bases of previous very specific match related data.

Implementation is to see and advise the players which part of their game they have to focus on, which part to improve and which part is their strong part.
